## 📝 Solution Overview

### **Problem 1: Three Ways to Sum to N**

Provided three unique JavaScript implementations:

1. **Iterative**: Standard loop for readability.
2. **Mathematical**: Gauss's formula for  efficiency.
3. **Recursive**: Functional approach (noted with recursion depth limits).

### **Problem 2: Fancy Form (Currency Swap)**

A professional DeFi-style swap interface.

* **Key Features**: Real-time exchange rate calculation, token filtering (omitting tokens without prices), and a simulated backend loading state.
* **Validation**: Interactive error handling for invalid amounts.

### **Problem 3: Messy React Refactoring**

Identified and resolved several critical "code smells":

* **Bug Fixes**: Corrected the `lhsPriority` undefined variable and fixed the filtering logic that was inadvertently hiding valid balances.
* **Performance**: Optimized `useMemo` by removing unnecessary dependencies (`prices`) to prevent redundant re-renders.
* **Type Safety**: Introduced a robust `WalletBalance` interface and eliminated `any` types to leverage TypeScript's full power.

### **Run Problem 3 (React)**

If you used the Vite template provided earlier:

1. `cd problem3`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
